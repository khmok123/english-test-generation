A hiker died as the heatwave hitting Hong Kong reached new heights on Sunday afternoon, when temperatures rose above 36 degrees Celsius, setting a new record as the hottest day in May ever recorded.

The Observatory reported a temperature of 36.1 degrees at about 2pm at its Tsim Sha Tsui headquarters, the highest May temperature since records began in 1884, dwarfing the previous high of 35.5 degrees in 1963.

The reading also marked the third-highest daily maximum for any month on record – after 36.6 degrees recorded in 2017 and 36.3 degrees in 2015 – matching a high of 36.1 degrees recorded in 1900 and 1990.
