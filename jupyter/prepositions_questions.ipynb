       "'Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician who was the 45th President of the United States from 2017 to 2021. Before becoming president, he was a businessman and television personality.\\nTrump was the chairman and president of The Trump Organization. Much of his money was made in real estate in New York City, Las Vegas, and Atlantic City. He used to own the Miss Universe pageant. He was the star in his own reality show The Apprentice. In October 2019, Trump changed his official residency state from New York to Florida.In June 2015, Trump announced that he would run for President of the United States in the 2016 presidential election, although most people did not expect him to win. Starting mid-July, polls showed that Trump was the front-runner in the Republican field, ahead of Ted Cruz. This was true even after much criticism from his party due to his comments on illegal immigration, Muslims, and ISIS. His campaign gained support from mostly middle-class and rural working class families. It gained opposition from Democrats, some Republicans, business people, some world leaders and the pope.On May 4, 2016, Trump became the presumptive nominee after his only remaining challengers, Texas United States senator Ted Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich, dropped out. He became the president-elect November 9, 2016, after a close race with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Each of them needed 270 electoral votes to win. Trump had 304 while Clinton had 227. He was inaugurated as the 45th president on January 20, 2017. At 70 years old, Trump became the oldest person ever to become President of the United States to that point, until Joe Biden was inaugurated four years later.\\nOn September 24, 2019, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives would begin an impeachment inquiry into Trump. On October 31, 2019, the House voted 232â€“196 to establish procedures for public hearings. On December 16, the House Judiciary Committee released a report specifying criminal bribery and wire fraud charges as part of the abuse of power charge. The house voted to impeach Trump in December 2019, making him the third president in American history to be impeached. He was acquitted by the Senate in February 2020.In November 2020, Trump lost his re-election bid to former Vice President Joe Biden following the 2020 election. He became the first president since George H. W. Bush in 1992 to lose his re-election bid. However, he still has not recognised his loss and claims to have won the election by a large amount. He is also suing states that went to Biden. In January 2021, Trump controversially called Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger trying to \"get more votes\" and reverse Biden\\'s win in the state. A few days later, his supporters rioted at the United States Capitol which killed five people. This led to the United States House of Representatives to impeach Trump for a second time. This made Trump the only president to be impeached twice. The United States Senate voted to have Trump not guilty of the indictment that the House of Representatives had him impeached on.'"
